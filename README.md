This library is meant to convert any flash display list hierarchy to an atlas, 
or many atlasses if hierarchy is really complex. 
The output is the atlas bitmap and configuration of this atlas (subtextures, atlas xml, hierarchy description etc.).

Supports:
 - MovieClips with many frames that are converted in frame movieclip clones
 - Buttons
 - Shapes
 - Complex MovieClips
